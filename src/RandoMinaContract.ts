/**
 * Represents the public input parameters for a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).
 * 
 * The PRNG algorithm is defined by the following parameters:
 * - networkState: The state of the network at the time of the PRNG computation. This value is used to ensure freshness of
 *     the random number. This provides the PRNG with the security guarantee against brute-force attacks, which could give
 *     an attacker an advantage in some contexts. This value could be either a single Mina blockchain network attribute, or
 *     a combination of them. It's important that this attribute is constant, unique and unpredictable for each Mina block.
 *     The proofs generated with this number will only be valid within the Mina block where this proof was generated.
 * - sender: The public key of the sender of the PRNG computation. This value is obtained by Poseidon-hasing the public key of the
 *    sender. This is the second part of the seed, and it is used as a global nonce, to ensure that the random numbers generated
 *    throughout the network have a unique seed component.
 * 
 * Additionally, the following private input is used:
 * - nonce: Any number, which is used as the "local seed/nonce" per (networkState, sender) pair. This enables each Mina address to
 *   be able to generate multiple (infinite) number of pseudo-random numbers in a single Mina block. If necesasry, nonce
 *   can also be used as a public input. This can be either done by extending the methods of the existing smart contract, or defining a new one.
